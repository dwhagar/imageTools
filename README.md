# imageTools

This repository contains a collection of tools and utilities developed specifically for my personal use. These tools are purpose-built to facilitate my workflows and projects.

## Usage
While these tools were created with my specific needs in mind, they are made available for anyone who might find them useful in their own projects or workflows. Please feel free to explore, use, and adapt these tools as you see fit.
* `nltk-download.py` downloads the necessary NLTK required files for the scripts to work properly.
* `memeRenamer.py` takes a directory and renames images and other files in that directory based on image contents.
* `manage-backgrounds.sh` is a bash shell script to upload and backup my wallpapers.
* `clean-backgrounds.py` is a script that deletes images in a directory which are either not the right aspect ratio or not high enough resolution.
